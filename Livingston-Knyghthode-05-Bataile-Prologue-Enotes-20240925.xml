        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/livingston-knyghthode/blob/main/livingston-knyghthode-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="1">1<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Hail</hi>. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 43</ref>, below.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">1–2<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">kalende / Of Marche</hi>. In their edition, D&amp;A (pp. xvi–xvii) go to some length to try to match the poem’s dating here (March 1) with the dating of their assumed occasion for composition: the Loveday between Yorkists and Lancastrians on March 25, 1458. The proem, however, should almost assuredly be dated to an entry into London on March 1, 1460. The subsequent book itself, in order to be presented on that day, must have been written earlier, quite possibly in Coventry in the last week of November or the first week of December 1459 (see the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">Introduction, pp. 2–3</ref>). Many factors might have influenced the delay between the composition and the presentation of the book, but it could be that March, being named for the god of war, was thought a fitting time for a book on war.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">2–3<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">wheryn David the Confessour / Commaunded is his Kyngis court ascende</hi>. Wakelin (“Occasion, Author, and Readers,” p. 267) is correct to observe that this is not, as D&amp;A suggest (pp. xvii–xviii), a reference to the ascension of King David to the throne of Israel, but instead a reference to the patron saint of Wales, St. David the Confessor. However, Wakelin errs in suggesting that the poet nevertheless “seems to confuse” the two figures by referring to the <hi rend="italic">kyngis court</hi>. St. David’s March 1 feast day celebrates both the life and the death of the saint (when he was called to the court of his king, i.e., God).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">9–15<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And she . . . hidir sende</hi>. Because the “structure of the sentence is not clear,” D&amp;A term “the whole vision . . . extremely hazy” (p. 111n13–16). This implication may be due to their reading of <hi rend="italic">anende</hi> in line 10 as <hi rend="italic">an ende</hi>, which does indeed strain the grammar. Repaired, however, the vision seems quite clear: the poet calls for blessings upon the Virgin Mary, who comes into the procession alongside her son, accompanied by the uncountable flights of arrayed angels that they command. Nall argues that the poet goes beyond this, attempting to identify Henry VI with Christ in this imagery (<hi rend="italic">Reading and War</hi>, pp. 125–29).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">13–15<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">And ordir . . . hidir sende</hi>. The poet foreshadows his text’s integral interest in establishing a proper order for the realm — explicit in the ordering of its military forces, implicit in the unification of Yorkists and Lancastrians under the king’s rule — by presenting the arrival of the angels according to their own hierarchy and under their own royal command (see <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to lines 9–15</ref>, above). The tradition of the nine orders of the angels on which he relies extends back to the popular fifth-century work <hi rend="italic">De coelesti hierarchia</hi> [<hi rend="italic">On the Celestial Hierarchy</hi>], by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, from whom it was adopted by St. Thomas Aquinas (<hi rend="italic">Summa Theologica</hi> 1.108). The nine orders, which will be listed in full in lines 152–58, are, in ascending order: angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues, dominations, thrones, cherubim, and seraphim.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">17–20<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">But Kyng Henry . . . now wel</hi>. The poet’s political aims are highlighted early, as he corresponds Henry VI’s entry into London with the sacred and celestial visitation just given. Just as all are made one in Christ, so, too, will all be made one through the king. Nall goes further, suggesting that the author is portraying Henry VI as a figuration of Christ, such that disobedience to the king (i.e., through rebellion) becomes heresy (<hi rend="italic">Reading and War</hi>, pp. 130–34). Regardless, the fact that this hope came to naught is clear not just in the historical continuation of the Wars of the Roses until at least 1487 but in the poem’s manuscript record, as well: subsequent references to the Lancastrian King Henry VI in the alternative manuscripts were emended to refer to the Yorkist King Edward IV (see the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">Introduction, pp. 11–13</ref>).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">21<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi>. One of the most common Christian hymns, <hi rend="italic">Te Deum laudamus</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Thee, O God, we praise</hi>] was sung to give thanks to God. As a hymn that calls for God’s blessing upon an event, it would be appropriate for both the royal entry into London here described and the feast day on which the event is supposedly taking place.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">22–24<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Benedicta Sancta Trinitas . . . Unitas</hi>. The poet here incorporates the beginning of the Introit for Trinity Sunday: <hi rend="italic">Benedicta sit Sancta Trinitas, atque indivisa Unitas</hi> [Blessed be the Holy Trinity, and undivided Unity].</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">25<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Deo gratias</hi>. The traditional phrase <hi rend="italic">Deo gratias</hi> [Thanks be to God] completes the Latin Mass, which makes it a suitable conclusion to the poet’s opening vision of celestial and sacred blessings upon Henry VI’s entry.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">25–28<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Therof . . . then now</hi>. The poet here parallels the celestial Trinity with a secular trinity of the three estates of the Middle Ages: the clergy, the military, and the commons.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">41<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Te Deum laudamus</hi>. See <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">note to line 21</ref>, above.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">43<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">honor, virtus</hi>. The poet here quotes the hymn <hi rend="italic">Tantum ergo Sacramentum</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Therefore so great a Sacrament</hi>], written by St. Thomas Aquinas, which has liturgical use in the benediction of the Blessed Sacrament: the hymn praises the Trinity with <hi rend="italic">salus, honor, virtus</hi> [hail, honor, virtue]. The first of these terms does not occur here, but might be implied in the “Hail” of line 1, thus neatly framing this opening of Trinitarian praise.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">45–46<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Thi bille . . . not foryete</hi>. The poet’s petition to the king appears to be his request to dedicate <hi rend="italic">Of Knyghthode and Bataile</hi> to him, as described in the subsequent lines.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">47<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">my lord Beaumont</hi>. On Beaumont, see the <ref target="insert-internal-link" type="internal">Introduction, pp. 2–3</ref>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">56<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Sumtyme it was the gise</hi>. What Beaumont begins reading is line 89, the start of the translation proper.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">61–80<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">I wil considir . . . exemplifying techeth</hi>. As D&amp;A punctuate it, Beaumont’s speech that begins at line 61 does not end until the completion of the proem. To the contrary, it is here assumed that the lord’s directive that the poet present the book to the king (line 64) prompts just such a presentation (lines 65–80). One cause for D&amp;A’s reading may be the placement of a period after <hi rend="italic">Offreth for ye</hi> (in line 77), which violates a clear mark of punctuation after <hi rend="italic">Offreth</hi> and the capitalization and rubrication of the following <hi rend="italic">For</hi>.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">79–80<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Accepte it . . . exemplifying techeth</hi>. One reading of these lines, Nall observes, is that the poet suggests “that the practice of war leads to God: ‘mighty war leads by examples to this supreme conqueror’. If so, this is an audacious claim: the author is effectively stating that the pursuit of war leads to God” (<hi rend="italic">Reading and War</hi>, p. 118).</note>
