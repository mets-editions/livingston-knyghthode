        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s), textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor, congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p><correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in order to correct errors and improve glosses. For a full list of editorial and typographical corrections made to this edition, please view its correction log on Github: https://github.com/mets-editions/livingston-knyghthode/blob/main/livingston-knyghthode-export-corrections-log.docx</p>

 <note type="enote" n="1">626–27<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">To rede a thinge withoute intelligence, / As seith Cato the wise, is negligence</hi>. The Latin form of this proverb, <hi rend="italic">Legere et non intelligere neglegare est</hi>, concludes the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Distichs of Cato</hi> (ed. and trans. Chase, p. 12), a collection of sayings on wisdom and morality. Written in the third or fourth century by Dionysius Cato (not the more famous Cato the Elder, as often assumed), the <hi rend="italic">Distichs of Cato</hi> was enormously popular throughout the Middle Ages and well into the eighteenth century.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="2">633–34<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">As myghti herte . . . metris springe</hi>. This statement on knights appreciating poetry has many echoes in courtly poetry of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="3">640<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Crede</hi>. That is, the Apostles’ Creed, a brief statement of Christian faith that, by tradition, goes back to the Twelve Apostles of Jesus.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="4">642–43<space rend="indent1"/>The reference is to the first line of Vergil’s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>: <hi rend="italic">arma virumque cano</hi> (I sing [of] arms and a man).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="5">651–53<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">In too maner . . . up and doun</hi>. The two kinds of vessels, according to Vegetius, are <hi rend="italic">liburnae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lusoriae</hi>, but which English equivalent terms the poet thinks are so well known that they need not be mentioned is unknown to us now. D&amp;A suggest <hi rend="italic">barge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">balinger</hi>, which are possible but by no means certain (p. 123n652).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="6">660–62<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Confederat men . . . we in Fraunce</hi>. Both in Roman times and in the Middle Ages, it was a widespread practice to increase the size of the army by employing mercenaries, sometimes from quite foreign shores indeed. Here, the poet remarks on how this could mean Frenchmen fighting for the English and vice versa.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="7">672<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">diagalange</hi>. This term typically means a type of medicine, made primarily from galangal and sugar, that produced warmth and was employed to treat a variety of symptoms, including general illnesses, epilepsy, dropsy, and other excesses of cold humors (Ed. Norri, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Medical Vocabulary</hi>, 1:288). The term is used figuratively here to mean superfluous detail (s. v. <hi rend="italic">diagalange</hi>; see also <hi rend="italic">MED diagalange</hi>). Writers were familiar with such medical terms, as they were found in a number of sources, especially in herbals and collections of medical recipes, that were commonly included in unrelated manuscripts.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="8">673<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">not worth a pulled hen</hi>. Proverbial; see Whiting H347, and compare Chaucer, whose Monk so disregarded the Benedictine Rule that “He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> I[A]177).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="9">716<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">chivalers . . . the flour</hi>. It is a late-medieval commonplace to refer to the best example of something as its “flower,” but referring to the finest knights as the flower of chivalry or knighthood became particularly popular during the Hundred Years War (see <hi rend="italic">MED flour</hi> [n.1], senses 5a, 5c). See, e.g., Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale, in which Arcite is referred to as “of chivalrie flour” (<hi rend="italic">CT</hi> I[A]3059).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="10">718<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">VIIIXX and VI of wight horsmen</hi>. ‘Eight twenties and six’ (=166) cavalrymen differs from the expected count of 136 (the total for the entire legion being 730, as the poet confirms in line 749). As D&amp;A rightly observe, manuscripts of Vegetius vacillate between 132 and 136, but none agree with the poet’s number here (p. 124n718).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="11">749<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">VII C . . . and XXX</hi>. The best Latin copies of Vegetius, as used by Reeve in his critical edition, record 730 here, as the poet does. Milner’s translation, however, follows a different family of manuscripts that record 726.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="12">782–88<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">The clarioner . . . it prevaile</hi>. Vegetius names three different kinds of horns — <hi rend="italic">tuba</hi>, <hi rend="italic">cornu</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">buccina</hi> — along with three corresponding players for them, and the poet gamely tries to translate these Latin words into English, but it seems clear that he was unsure exactly what Vegetius intended. Modern scholars are in no better position. How these instruments ought to be defined is much disputed, including whether there were even three different instruments in the first place. Our glosses try to reflect this vague differentiation. On the general concept of using musical instruments for signaling in medieval battles, see Contamine, “La musique militaire.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="13">797–98<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">and so to IIII and V, / That hadde wage, uche aftir his estate</hi>. Vegetius lists single, double, and pay-and-a-half for various ranks of <hi rend="italic">torquati</hi>; the poet’s furthering of the principle here may have more to do with rhyme schemes than reality.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="14">802<hi rend="italic"><space rend="indent1"/>the souldeours, uch othrys mate</hi>. The poet appears to collapse the final rank of the officer class, Vegetius’s <hi rend="italic">munera</hi>, with the common soldiery.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="15">803<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">principal prince of the legioun</hi>. Vegetius refers here to the <hi rend="italic">primus princeps</hi>, typically meaning the most veteran of the centurions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="16">845<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">Not LX</hi>. The various figures given above suggest that this was supposed to be 50, not 60, and that <hi rend="italic">LX</hi> is a scribal error followed also in C and R (leaf missing in A).</note>
 <note type="enote" n="17">852<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">consulys</hi>. Whether for poetic reasons or out of ignorance, the poet fails to note that the legates sent by the emperor are ex-consuls, not current ones.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="18">869<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">in payne or deth t’anende</hi>. It was becoming more common to have ordinances for English armies from the end of the fourteenth century onwards. These listed illicit behavior and the sorts of punishment that could be expected. In some cases, such as desertion, pillaging, and killing fellow soldiers, men could be executed. See Curry, “Military Ordinances.”</note>
 <note type="enote" n="19">927<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">by rowe</hi>. That is, the ensigns for each century had markings to indicate both the cohort and the placement of the men within it.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="20">930–31<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">in their salet / That had a creste of fetherys or lik flourys</hi>. The poet is here using <hi rend="italic">sallet</hi> to mean a general type of helmet, not the specific variety that we might use the word for, in order to fit the meter.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="21">946<space rend="indent1"/><hi rend="italic">spende his wepon wel withoute waste</hi>. Where Vegetius observes that a good centurion is properly trained in a set of martial drills, the poet translates this theoretical art into its practical effects: a warrior relying on trained skills is more efficient in his actions.</note>
 <note type="enote" n="22">977–78<space rend="indent1"/>The poet omits Vegetius’s chapters 15–25, a large portion of Book 2. D&amp;A suggest that this may be due to “an accidental gap” in the surviving manuscript record, though the initial line of Book 3 “would rather seem to point to intentional condensation” (p. 129n977). The omitted chapters provide details on the ancient legion: its battle-order (chapters 15–18) and administration (chapters 19–25). The poet may well have regarded this material, which was not in full use even in the time of Vegetius, as having particularly little contemporary value.</note>
